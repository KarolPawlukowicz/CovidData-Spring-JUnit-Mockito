# CovidData-Spring-JUnit-Mockito
This is a simple CRUD application with Covid data from Poland.

When you first run this application it should fetch Covid data like number of deaths, number of infections and number of recovered people since 01.22.2020 from this github repository: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19. 

You can view all this data. You can also delete and update data from a selected day and you can add your own Covid data.
